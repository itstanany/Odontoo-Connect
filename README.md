### Architecture Overview

![architecture](https://github.com/tanany365/Odontoo-Connect/blob/main/assets/system-design-odontoo-AddContact.drawio.png)

The overall architecture of **Odontoo Connect** is composed of three layers; the UI layer, domain layer and the data layer. Each layer has dedicated components and they have each different responsibilities, as defined below:

### Presentation Layer

![architecture](https://github.com/tanany365/Odontoo-Connect/blob/main/assets/arch-presentation-layer.png)

The Presentation layer consists of UI elements to configure screens that could interact with users and [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) that holds app states and restores data when configuration changes.

**Unidirectional** Data flow principle is applied through firing events from Screen UI and passing data toward Screen


### Domain Layer

### Data Layer

![architecture](https://github.com/tanany365/Odontoo-Connect/blob/main/assets/arch-data-layer.png)

The data Layer consists of repositories implementation, which include business logic, such as querying data from the local database.. It is implemented as an offline source of business logic and follows the [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) principle.<br>

**Odontoo Connect** is an offline app is an app that is able to perform all core functionality without access to the internet.
